							<h1>Assignment 3 - Computer-aided design and 3D printing</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/verk2_007.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Description</h2>
							<p>1. Use a design software to make something that could not be made subtractively,<br />
                            and 3D print your design (Max 4 hour printing / 100g material)<br />
                            2. 3D scan something with 3D photogrammetry<br />
                            3. Document the process and upload your design files</p>
                            <h2>Define the problem.</h2>
                            <p>I needed to design a shell over a robotic chassis and calculate for components. <br />
                            The shell had to many details and the complexity is to great for substractive progress</p>

                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_000.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>I started by sketching on paper and measure all relevant dimensions.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_001.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_002.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>I started my CAD-scetch using SolidWorks</h2>
                            <ul class="actions">
							   <li><a href="https://solidworks.com/" class="button">Learn More about SolidWorks</a></li>
						    </ul>
                            <h2>I started with basic outlines.</h2>
                            <p>It was important that I would create the sketch with accurate dimensions, so it would fit right on the chassis.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_003.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Then I used fillet to smoothen all edges.</h2>
                            <p>I also added some details to make it look more like a car. For excample I added headlights</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_004.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Then I made the design hollow with the shell tool.</h2>
                            <p>Here it was important to select the correct surfaces for the shell to fit right on top of the chassis and allow for components. The shell thickness was 3mm. </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_005.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Prepare the design for the 3D printer.</h2>
                            <p>Because I needed the design to be in specific size I had to print it in full size as a created it in SolidWorks. For it to fit into the 3D printer I had to cut it up in 4 pieces and I could 3D print 2 pieces at a time. Here you can see the right side of the shell in two pieces.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_006.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_007.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>I then printed it in Ultimaker 3 - 3D printer.</h2>
                            <p>I used Cura to finish the preparations and adjust the right settings for the 3D printer.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_008.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_009.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Assembly.</h2>
                            <p>Here I used super-glue to put it together and bolts to make the edges of the pieces align correctly. <br />
                            What I learned from the print is that when you 3D print holes the diameter decreases. I used drill to <br />
                            make them the correct size. I also learned that it is always faster to print/build directly upwards <br />
                            when 3D printing so I have that in mind now when I make 3D designs.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_010.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Spray painted, with white spray for plastic.</h2>
                            <p>I used sandpaper to make the surface more smooth before I spray painted it.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_011.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Installation.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_012.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>I then sketched a patern for the shell and painted it on.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_013.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_014.jpg" alt="" data-rotate="90" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Part 2 - 3D scan .</h2>
                            <p>I wanted to 3D scan the whole car that I had created the shell for. I started by taking 30 photos of the car from diffrent angles.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_015.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Create the 3D model of the object from the photos.</h2>
                            <p>I used AutoDesk ReCap Photo to create the 3D model from the photos.</p>
                            <ul class="actions">
							   <li><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/recap/overview" class="button">Learn More about AutoDesk ReCap</a></li>
						    </ul>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_016.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_01602.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Then I edited the model using tools in AutoDesk ReCap.</h2>
                            <p>I cut the base off and deleted from the model. Then I made all surface more even and cut out all smaller details that where not supposed to be there. I learned that your model will not be 100% accurate 
                            and that you have to take a lots of photos, with a good camera, to increase accuracy. However I was reasonably happy with the outcome as I didn't need it to be more accurate.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_017.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_018.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>Export as .stl file</h2>
                            <p>I had to make .stl file from the model to be able to open it in Cura and prepare it for the Ultimaker 3- 3D printer. </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_019.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>
                            <h2>... and now I have a miniature model of the car that I built with my team.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/verk3_020.jpg" alt="" width="850"/></span>

                            <h2>I had the perfect spot for it, insede the laser-cut box I made for assignment 2.</h2>
