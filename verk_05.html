                            <h2>Description</h2>
							<p>This is how me and my team made something big for this class.</p>
                            <ul class="actions">
							   <li><a href="projects.html" class="button">See my team</a></li>
						    </ul>
                            <h2>Our solution</h2>
							<p>We as a group are working on doing an 3D printer. Still we decided to pick this project because it we thougt it would be fun though it's not connected to our final project.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
							<p>W/e found a nice cat house on Pinterest and saw it cost's $300 online. We thougt the plywood that was supposed to be used in this project would be just as relevant. The goal was to make a cat house that would be cheaper but based on the desing found on Pinterest.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/v4_001_inspo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <h2>The design</h2>
                            <p>First was to design the house in solidworks and define parameters. Length, height, depth and material thickness was defined as parameters.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/v4_002_design.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <h2>Simulation</h2>
                            <p>Due to actuality we could not attend the lecture for learning on the ShopBot. FabLab is closed so we could not do the milling on the ShopBot. Though we followed a YouTube video and made a simulation of the milling. The only thing that couldn't be done was the deegres on the edges for the roof, it would need a little bit more researche to find out how to make that happen. Another solution would be to make it a pressfit design. But since we are not cutting it out we did'nt think it was neccessary.</p>
                            <ul class="actions">
							   <li><a href="https://youtu.be/v_bM2nY9aD8" class="button">See video</a></li>
						    </ul>
                            <p>Ready for simulation. The only thing left after the simulation is to post.</p>
