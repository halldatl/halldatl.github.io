							<h1>Molding and casting</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/moldingandcasting.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <h2>Description</h2>
							<p>This is how me and my team made molding and casting for one of the parts we used in our final project.</p>
                            <ul class="actions">
							   <li><a href="projects.html" class="button">See my team</a></li>
						    </ul>
                            <h2>Our solution</h2>
							<p>In this project the objective was to make a mold for a part and then casting that mold with epoxy meterial. 3D printing can take alot of time and making a mold for a massevly produced part can cut the manufacturing time of that part and the whole product by alot.</p>
                            <p>We decided to make a mold of a part in the 3D printer we were currently building. The part we decided to make a mold of and cast is a x-carriage for the hotend. This item is attached to the hotend holder that the hotend is mounted to. Through the sides it is connection to two horizontal smooth rods through bearings that are mounted inside of the two 15,2 mm cylindrical cuts.</p>

                            <h2>Here we can see where the part will fit into the 3D printer. If we ever want to mass produce this 3D printer the mold will speed up the process.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC002_prentaristadsetning.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We started by opening the part in assembly in Solidworks and created a new part inside the assembly. To create the part we drew a box on the edge of the part that fully enclosed the visable portion of the x-carriage.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC003_moldteikning.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We the extruded it so the new part covered an area bigger than the part and fully enclosing the part.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC004_extrude_mold.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We then could go on to make a cavity in the newly modeled mold using the part.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC005_carriageandmold.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>Go to insert > features > cavity.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC006_cavity.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>Then we select the x-carriage to make a cavity in our new part.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC007" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>Here we can see the outcome of the mold.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC008_mold1.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>The cylinder shapes in the mold created a problem. They made a "roof" where the part is supposed to be pulled out of the mold.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC009" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We modified the part so it would be possible to pull the part out of the mold. This modification has no effect on the functionallity of the part. We then repeated the steps above.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC010_fixing.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We then cut extruded the "poles" out of the mold. We want to 3D print them as a separate part so it is possible to pull them out after the material has hardened. If we would not do this then the poles would be a blockade for the part when trying to pull it out of the mold.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC012_holes_x_carriage.jpg" alt="" height="500"/></span>
                            <h2>We finally make the poles needed to be inserted as a separate part in Solidworks.</h2>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/MC011_poles.png" alt="" height="500"/></span>
